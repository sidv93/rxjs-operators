<h3 style="text-align: center">Combine Latest</h3>
<p>CombinLatest combines two individual observables into one and emits the latest value from each.</p>
<p>In this example, we have two buttons, we take the click events from both and apply the operator to display how many times both of them are clicked.</p>
<br><br>
<button #button1>Button 1</button>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<button #button2>Button 2</button>

<p>{{combineLatestResult | async}}</p>
