<h3 style="text-align: center">Concat</h3>
<p>Concat combines two individual observables just like combine but emits values from the second observable only when the first observable completes</p>
<p>In this example, we are emitting [1,2,3] from the first observable and [4,5,6] from the second. Even if they start at once, it will always be 1,2,3,4,5,6</p>
