<h3 style="text-align: center">Throttle time</h3>
<p>Throttle emits the latest value when the duration has passed. Kind of the opposite of debounceTime</p>
<p>In this example, we are putting an input from textbox through throttle of 3s</p>
<br><br>
<input type="text" #text>
<br>
<p>{{throttleResult$ | async}}</p>
