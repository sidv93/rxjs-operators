<h3 style="text-align: center">Fork join</h3>
<p>Forkjoin emits the final value of grouped observables. It only emits the value when all of the observables have emitted their values as an array. Use forkJoin when you only care about the final values of multiple observables</p>
<p>In this example, we use forkJoin to different types of observables</p>
