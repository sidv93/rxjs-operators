<h3 style="text-align: center">Merge Map</h3>
<p>Merge map is used when you want to maintain a list of subscriptions inside. Typically, used for slow requests when you dont want to lose subscriptions which take longer.
  Switchmap does the same, nut it switches to the latest subscription. Concatmap also does the same, but it emits in the order of subscription.

<p>In this example, we use mergemap on a simple Hello world emission.</p>
