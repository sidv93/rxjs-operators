<h3 style="text-align: center">With Latest From</h3>
<p>With Latest from is a lazier version of combineLatest, where it only emits the value if the source observable emits a value. When the source emits a value, it grabs the latest from the provided observable and emits both</p>
<p>In this example, we have a source interval emitting every 5s and a provided interval which emits at 1s</p>
